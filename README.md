# CAFE-MACHINE
This Python-based café vending machine simulates a real-world beverage dispenser. The program allows users to select a drink from a menu, prompts them to enter payment using coins, and checks if the amount is sufficient. If the entered amount is less than the drink’s price, it notifies the user of insufficient funds. If the payment is correct or exceeds the price, the machine calculates and returns change before dispensing the selected drink.

Key Features:

Menu-based drink selection
Coin-based payment system
Validation of sufficient funds
Automatic calculation and return of change
Simulated drink dispensing 
This project demonstrates basic concepts of conditional statements, loops, functions, and user interaction in Python.
